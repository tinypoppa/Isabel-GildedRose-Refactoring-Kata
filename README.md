# Isabel-GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata
This is my implementation of the ConjuredItem support for the Techinical Review.

The base code has been refactor and organise in a more prgmatic and maintainable code structure. 
As a resesult will facilitate agile changes.

# What has changed
As the initial code base, included some bad coding such as spagethe coding style.
I have employed design patterns like Factory Patern to hide the formation of the client object request.
Futhermore, the use of the Stategy Pattern enables the application to dynamic soource the type of request at runtime.

All these has facilitated the code rerun and enhance the agility of the application for change.

# How to use this Isabel-GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata
The simplest way is to just clone the code and run as a maven prject as in my case.
